# kafkaskewer
It is a playful for YouTube channel name inspired by the phonetic similarity between "Kafka" (the data streaming platform) and "kafta skewer" (a popular Middle Eastern and Brazilian dish), which can create amusing confusion for those unfamiliar with distributed systems, or spark curiosity and even a smile.
